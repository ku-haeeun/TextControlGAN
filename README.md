# TextControlGAN
GAN-INT-CLS + Controllable GAN <br>

•	A text-to-image synthesis model called TextControlGAN is proposed.<br>
•	TextControlGAN uses ControlGAN-based architectures.<br>
•	A regressor is adopted for the conditional text learning.<br>
•	TextControlGAN is evaluated with a bird image dataset.<br>
